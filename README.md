# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application inspired by the popular accommodation booking platform **Airbnb**.  
It enables users to browse listings, view detailed property information, and complete secure bookings.

The project is divided into two major parts:
- **Frontend Pro Dev**: Focused on creating responsive, accessible, and visually appealing user interfaces.
- **Backend Pro Dev**: Focused on developing scalable APIs, database systems, and secure backend services.

## Project Goals
- Build a **functional booking platform** with end-to-end flow â€” from browsing to booking.  
- Practice **team collaboration** using Git and GitHub workflows.
