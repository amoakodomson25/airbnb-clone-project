## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and user profiles.  
Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their personal details. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access or modify sensitive data.

### Property Management
Allows property owners to list, edit, and manage their properties.  
This includes uploading images, setting prices, and updating descriptions. It enables hosts to showcase their listings effectively and attract potential guests.

### Booking System
Manages property availability and reservations.  
Users can book available properties, view booking history, and cancel or modify reservations. This is the core functionality that connects hosts and guests in the system.

### Review and Rating
Enables guests to leave feedback on properties after their stay.  
Reviews help build trust between users and provide transparency about property quality and host performance.

### Payment Processing
Facilitates secure online payments for bookings.  
It handles transactions, refunds, and payment confirmations, ensuring a smooth and reliable financial workflow.

### Admin Dashboard
Provides administrative oversight and control.  
Admins can monitor user activity, manage listings, handle reports, and maintain overall platform quality and compliance.


## API Security

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
Ensures that only registered and verified users can access the system.  
We will use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity for every API request. This helps prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

#### 2. Authorization
Controls user permissions and defines what actions each user role can perform.  
For example, a host can manage their properties, while guests can only make bookings. This prevents users from performing actions outside their access level.

#### 3. Rate Limiting
Limits the number of API requests a user or IP can make within a specific time frame.  
This helps protect the system from abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and ensures fair usage of server resources.

#### 4. Data Encryption
All sensitive information, such as passwords and payment details, will be encrypted using strong hashing and SSL/TLS protocols.  
Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to unauthorized parties.

#### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization
Every API input will be validated to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.  
This ensures that only clean and safe data enters the system, maintaining data integrity and protecting backend services.

### Importance of Security

- **Protecting User Data:** Safeguards personal information like emails, passwords, and contact details from breaches.  
- **Securing Payments:** Ensures that all financial transactions are encrypted and authenticated to prevent fraud.  
- **Maintaining Trust:** Users must feel confident that their information and transactions are secure.  
- **Preventing System Abuse:** Measures like rate limiting and authorization maintain fair and safe usage across all users.

Robust API security not only protects the platform but also ensures compliance with data privacy standards and provides a safe user experience.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview
A **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code.  
It ensures that every change made to the project is automatically integrated, tested, and delivered efficiently, reducing manual errors and speeding up development.

### Importance
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline allows the team to:
- Detect and fix bugs early through automated testing.  
- Maintain consistent build quality across environments.  
- Deploy new updates quickly and reliably.  
- Improve collaboration between developers, testers, and DevOps engineers.  

This helps ensure the system remains stable, scalable, and easy to update as new features are introduced.

### Tools and Technologies
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating build, test, and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker:** To containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.  
- **Jenkins or GitLab CI:** Optional tools for managing complex pipelines or multi-stage deployments.  
- **AWS / Heroku:** For deploying and hosting the application in a scalable environment.

Together, these tools create an automated and reliable process for integrating code changes, testing functionality, and deploying updates to production.
